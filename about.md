I am a beginner father, my sons were born in 2012 and 2014.
I work for a mid-sized company called [Virgo Systems](http://www.virgo.hu/) in Hungary as a developer and I really enjoy my job. I mostly use PHP and node.js, however, in my lonely hours I enjoy learning and experimenting with scala and akka.

I write here about things I meet in my life, my job.
