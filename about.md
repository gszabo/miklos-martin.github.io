I am a beginner father, my sons were born in 2012 and 2014 and my daughter in 2016.

I work for a fascinating company called [Emarsys](https://www.emarsys.com){:target="_blank"} in Hungary as a developer and I really enjoy my job. I mostly use scala, however, in my lonely hours I enjoy learning and experimenting with haskell, clojure and functional programming in general.

I write here about things I meet in my life, my job.
